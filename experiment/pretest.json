      "question": "Decrease in volume of soil mass due to expulsion of air voids is known as __________.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Consolidation",
        "b": "Shrinkage",
        "c": "Compression",
        "d": "Bulking"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Decrease of volume of soil mass due to the expulsion of water voids due to the gradual increase in static load is called consolidation.",
        "b": "The volume change which occurs due to the change in moisture content is termed as shrinkage.",
        "c": "Decrease in volume of soil mass due to the expulsion of air voids is termed as compression",
        "d": "It is the property of sand to increase in volume due to addition of moisture content. The increased total volume of moist fine aggregate over the same dry mass."

    {
      "question": "The consolidation of a soil mass can also be schematically explained using the ______________ .",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Spring analogy",
        "b": "Soil phase diagram",
        "c": "Soil particle distribution",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The consolidation can also be explained using the spring analogy where spring represents the soil structure and water in the container represents pore water in the soil.",
        "b": "Soil phase diagram is representation of different phases separated in soil.",
        "c": "Soil particle distribution is the separation of soil particles according to the size of the soil.",
        "d": "The correct answer is provided in the above option."

          "c": "Physical conditions",
          "d": "All of the above"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "The rate of escape of pore water depends on soil type and its property.",
          "b": "Permeability is the ability of water to pass through the pores present in the soil, Hence rate of escape of pore water is directly proportional to permeability.",
          "c": "Rate of escape of pore water also depends on the physical condition of soil.",
          "d": "The rate of escape of pore water is directly proportional to all the above provided options i.e type of soil, Permeability, Physical condition."

          "a": "Pressure pad",
          "b": "Filter paper",
          "c": "Porous stone",
          "d": "Steel scale"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Pressure pads with steel balls  are placed on the top of porous stone which is used to exert pressure on it.",
          "b": "Filter paper is a layer used between soil specimen and porous stone to avoid entry of soil particles to pores of stone.",
          "c": "Porous stone is placed above and below the soil specimen  to represent the previous soil layer in the field.",
          "d": "Steel scale is used to measure the dimensions, where no measurement is required in this experiment."

          "d": "None of the above"
        },
        "explanations": {
          "a": "Triaxial testing machine is used to determine the shear strength of the soil.",
          "b": "Consoildometer is the apparatus used in the consolidation test experiment.",
